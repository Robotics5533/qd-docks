# Dashboard Notes

there are several different dashboards used by first teams

this is fairly well documented on firsts website:

[https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/index.html](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/index.html)


as far as I can tell the "default" dashboard that you get when downloading first tools is the Labview
dashboard, I have yet to get extra info confirming this so extra research is required, read the above docs
>_>

## Selecting An Autonomous / Sending Auton data to the dashboard

these are pretty well documented already on the first website
